# Depression_Integrated-Network

In our manuscript titled **"Symptomatology of First vs. Recurrent Episodes in Major Depressive Disorder and Its Relation to Brain Function and Structure,"** *Angeles-Valdez et al.*, in review. This repository provides our code implemented in this study.

The aim of this study was to investigate differences in symptomatology and brain structure/function between individuals experiencing their first episode of Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) and those with recurrent episodes. Using publicly available data from the MDD DIRECT consortium ([https://rfmri.org/REST-meta-MDD](https://rfmri.org/REST-meta-MDD)), we employed a psychopathological and multilevel network approach to understand the complex relationships between depressive symptoms and neurobiological changes.
